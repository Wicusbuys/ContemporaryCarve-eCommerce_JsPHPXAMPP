        <h4>OUR STORY</h4>
        <h3>CONTEMPORARY CARVE JOURNEY</h3>
        <div class="about__story--body">
          <p>
            When Willem Buys, a talented craftsman from South Africa, embarked
             on a design exchange in Australia, little did he know that it would
              pave the way for the humble beginnings of Contemporary Carve, a
               small woodworking shop. Driven by a passion for timeless furniture,
                an unwavering commitment to innovation, and a deep desire to elevate
                 South African design on a global platform, Willem returned to Johannesburg
                  with a vision that would shape the journey of his modest woodworking shop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through meticulous planning and honing their craft, Contemporary Carve proudly
             unveiled their inaugural collection of exquisite furniture at the local 100%
              Design Showcase. The crowning achievement arrived when their masterpiece,
               the Coronation bench, received the prestigious 'Best Furniture Design'
                award, providing a glimmer of recognition for the small woodworking shop.

            The impact of this accolade reverberated, propelling Contemporary Carve
             onto a broader stage. The Coronation bench found a cherished home with
              Karen Roos of Babylonstoren, while the support of esteemed design
               legend Gregor Jenkins served as a guiding light, opening doors to
                new possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fuelled by an unwavering dedication to innovation, Contemporary Carve
             continued to refine their craft, expanding their offerings within 
             their modest retail and collectible ranges. Nestled in the vibrant 
             West Rand of Johannesburg, the woodworking shop experienced gradual
              growth, fostering a close-knit team of passionate artisans.

            Over time, accolades and recognition trickled in,
             as their pieces found places in local galleries, private residences,
              and respected institutions. From modest exhibitions to partnerships
               with emerging designers, Contemporary Carve carved out a niche for
                itself, showcasing their meticulous craftsmanship and artistic vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, their modest retail and trade offerings grace the interiors of diverse
             homes, boutique hotels, cozy offices, and charming local eateries. Collaborations
              with like-minded artisans remain at the heart of Contemporary Carve's ethos,
               propelling their pursuit of innovation within their intimate woodworking shop.

            While their story is still unfolding, Willem Buys and the team at Contemporary
             Carve remain steadfast, driven by an unwavering desire to push boundaries,
              set new standards, and etch their mark in the world of South African design,
               one exquisite piece at a time.
